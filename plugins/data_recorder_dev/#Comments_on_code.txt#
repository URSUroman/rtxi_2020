We want to output noise with proba 1/2. Fot the cases when noise has to be output, there is no problem i.e. no need for rand()%100 check. However for the case when no noise has to be output, we have to count how much on average the corr_coeff is above the threshold corr_coeff whan the syllable of interest is sung. For bird I_09_10_2019 is is roughly 10-12 times.
So (x/100)*12=0.5 i.e. x ~ 4. The valid numers for rand()%100 are thus 99 98 97 96
